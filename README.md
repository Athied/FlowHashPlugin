# FlowHashPlugin
A plugin for Flow which hashes a string into md5, sha1, and sha256. Not on the plugin store because the instructions to add it weren't clear enough and I don't know what I'm doing.

Manual install:
1. Create a folder for it in Flow's plugins folder, accessed by entering 'userdata' into flow or going to C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Roaming\FlowLauncher (default path)
2. Download the latest release and unzip it into that new folder
3. Relaunch flow
