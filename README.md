# FlowHashPlugin
A plugin for Flow which hashes a string into md5, sha1, and sha256. Not on the plugin store because the instructions to add it weren't clear enough and I don't know what I'm doing.

Manual install:
1. Download and unzip the latest release into Flow's plugins folder, accessed by entering 'userdata' into flow or going to %appdata%\FlowLauncher\Plugins (default path)
2. Relaunch flow
